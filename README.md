# The Visual Computer ：“YOLO-DySE: Enhancing Multi-Target Substation Safety Monitoring with Dynamic Adaptive Data Enhancement”
YOLO-DySE: Enhancing Multi-Target Substation Safety Monitoring with Dynamic Adaptive Data Enhancement
1. Project Overview
This project is based on the paper "YOLO-DySE: Enhancing Multi-Target Substation Safety Monitoring with Dynamic Adaptive Data Enhancement" published in The Visual Computer. It proposes a novel deep learning model, YOLO-DySE, designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of multi-target detection (e.g., flames and safety helmets) in complex substation environments. The model incorporates dynamic adaptive data enhancement techniques and advanced feature extraction modules to achieve state-of-the-art performance. This repository provides the source code, documentation, and usage guidelines to facilitate the replication of experiments and evaluation of results.

3.2 Key Modules
3.2.1 Dynamic Adaptive Data Enhancement (DADE)
Function: Dynamically adjusts training data to enhance the model's adaptability to complex environments.

Core Methods:

Random Point Deformation: Simulates morphological changes in dynamic targets (e.g., flames) by generating random control points and applying piecewise affine transformations.

Erosion and Overlay: Performs erosion on flame images to remove noise and overlays them onto target images using grayscale masks.

Noise and Lighting Adjustments: Adds Gaussian noise, randomly adjusts brightness, and applies occlusion, translation, and cropping to improve robustness.

3.2.2 C3-SE Module
Function: Enhances feature extraction by integrating the SEAttention mechanism into the C3 module.

Improvements:

Introduces global information extraction and dynamic channel weighting for better multi-scale feature fusion.

Replaces the original C3 module in the configuration file dogs-CC-DYHEAD-SE.yaml.

3.2.3 DyLAMHead Module
Function: Dynamically adjusts attention weights for multi-scale features to improve detection accuracy in complex backgrounds.

Improvements:

Incorporates a lightweight attention mechanism (LAM) for dynamic feature weighting.

Replaces the original detection head in the configuration file dogs-CC-DYHEAD-SE.yaml.

3.2.4 δ-EIoU Loss Function
Function: Improves bounding box regression by reducing sensitivity to extreme aspect ratios.

Core Formula:

# Modified CIoU with regularization parameter δ
δ-EIoU = LIoU + Ldis + ( (w_pred - w_gt)^2 + δ ) + ( (h_pred - h_gt)^2 + δ )
Implementation: Directly modifies the CIoU calculation logic to include regularization terms for width and height differences.

4. Usage Guide

4.2 Model Training
Run the following command to start training:

python train.py --cfg models/dogs-CC-DYHEAD-SE.yaml --epochs 100 --batch-size 16
--cfg: Path to the model configuration file.

--epochs: Number of training epochs.

--batch-size: Batch size for training.

4.3 Object Detection
